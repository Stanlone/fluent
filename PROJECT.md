## Who This Is For

Single user. C1 English speaker, native Russian. Advanced learner who wants depth, nuance, and etymology — not beginner explanations or gamification.

---

## What This Must Never Do

- Explain words as if the user is a beginner
- Use gamification: no streaks, badges, points, or progress bars
- Use patronising encouragement ("Great job!", "You're doing amazing!")
- Suggest words the user didn't ask about
- Show ads or upsells

## Database Schema

**users** — `id` (uuid, PK), `email` (text, unique), `created_at` (timestamptz)

**user_preferences** — `id` (uuid, PK), `user_id` (uuid, FK → users), `topics` (text[]), `sources` (text[]), `notification_enabled` (bool, default false), `notification_time` (time, default '09:00')

**words** — `id` (uuid, PK), `user_id` (uuid, FK → users), `word` (text), `context` (text), `russian_definition` (text), `english_definition` (text), `synonyms` (jsonb), `etymology` (text), `created_at` (timestamptz)

**reviews** — `id` (uuid, PK), `user_id` (uuid, FK → users), `word_id` (uuid, FK → words), `ease_factor` (float, default 2.5), `interval_days` (int, default 1), `repetitions` (int, default 0), `next_review_at` (timestamptz), `last_reviewed_at` (timestamptz)

All tables have RLS enabled with policies restricting access to `auth.uid()`.
